## Usage

### Icon component

You can use the [Icon](/docs/pohon/components/icon) component with a `name` prop to display an icon:

::docs-pohon-preview{slug="icon"}
---
props:
  name: 'i-lucide:lightbulb'
  class: 'size-5'
---
::

::note
You can use any name from the <https://icones.js.org> collection.
::

::warning
When using collections with a dash (`-`), you need to separate the icon name from the collection name with a colon (`:`) as `@iconify/vue` does not handle this case like `@nuxt/icon`. For example, instead of `i-simple-icons:github` you need to write `i-simple-icons:github` or `simple-icons:github`.

Learn more about the [Iconify naming convention](https://iconify.design/docs/icon-components/vue/#icon).

### Component props

Some components also have an `icon` prop to display an icon, like the [Button](/docs/pohon/components/button) for example:

::docs-pohon-preview{slug="button"}
---
ignore:
  - color
  - variant
props:
  icon: i-lucide:sun
  variant: subtle
slots:
  default: Button

## Theme

You can change the default icons used by Pohon UI components in your `vite.config.ts`:

:icons-theme
