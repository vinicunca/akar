## Installation

To get started, you can follow the official [guide](https://content.nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation) or in summary:

::code-group{sync="pm"}

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @nuxt/content
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @nuxt/content
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @nuxt/content
```

::

Then, add the `@nuxt/content` module in your `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts] {4}
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    'pohon-ui',
    '@nuxt/content'
  ],
})
```

::caution
You need to register `@nuxt/content` after `pohon-ui` in the `modules` array, otherwise the prose components will not be available.
::

## Components

You might be using `@nuxt/content` to build a documentation. To help you with that, we've built some components that you can use in your pages:

- a built-in full-text search command palette with [ContentSearch](/docs/pohon/components/content-search), replacing the need for Algolia DocSearch
- a navigation tree with the [ContentNavigation](/docs/pohon/components/content-navigation) component
- a sticky Table of Contents with the [ContentToc](/docs/pohon/components/content-toc) component
- a prev / next navigation with the [ContentSurround](/docs/pohon/components/content-surround) component

## Typography

Pohon UI provides its own custom implementations of all prose components for seamless integration with `@nuxt/content`. This approach ensures consistent styling, complete control over typography, and perfect alignment with the Pohon UI design system so your content always looks and feels cohesive out of the box.

## Utils

### `mapContentNavigation`

This util will map the navigation from `queryCollectionNavigation` and transform it recursively into an array of objects that can be used by various components.

`mapContentNavigation(navigation, options?)`
- `navigation`: The navigation tree (array of ContentNavigationItem).
- `options` (optional):
  - `labelAttribute`: (string) Which field to use as label (`title` by default)
  - `deep`: (number or undefined) Controls how many levels of navigation are included (`undefined` by default : includes all levels)

**Example:** As shown in the breadcrumb example below, it's commonly used to transform the navigation data into the correct format.

```vue [app.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
import { mapContentNavigation } from 'pohon-ui/utils/content'
import { findPageBreadcrumb } from '@nuxt/content/utils'

const { data: navigation } = await useAsyncData('navigation', () => queryCollectionNavigation('content'))

const breadcrumb = computed(() => mapContentNavigation(findPageBreadcrumb(navigation?.value, page.value?.path, { indexAsChild: true })).map(({ icon, ...link }) => link), { deep: 0 })
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <template #headline>
      <PBreadcrumb :items="breadcrumb" />
    </template>
  </div>
</template>
```
