## Core technologies

### Akar

Pohon UI is built on top of [Akar](/docs/akar/overview) as a foundation for the components:

- **WAI-ARIA Compliance**: Follows [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](/docs/akar/overview/accessibility) with proper semantics and roles
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Built-in keyboard support for complex components like tabs and dialogs
- **Focus Management**: Intelligent focus handling that moves focus based on user interactions
- **Accessible Labels**: Abstractions to simplify labeling controls for screen readers

### UnoCSS Variants

Pohon UI takes advantage of [UnoCSS Variants](https://vinicunca.dev/unocss-variants) to provide a powerful theming system:

- **Dynamic Styling**: Flexible component variants with a powerful API
