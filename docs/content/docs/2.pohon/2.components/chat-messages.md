## Usage

The ChatMessages component displays a list of [ChatMessage](/docs/components/chat-message) components using either the default slot or the `messages` prop.

```vue {2,8}
<template>
  <UChatMessages>
    <UChatMessage
      v-for="(message, index) in messages"
      :key="index"
      v-bind="message"
    />
  </UChatMessages>
</template>
```

::callout{icon="i-lucide-rocket"}
This component is purpose-built for AI chatbots with features like:

- Initial scroll to the bottom upon loading ([`shouldScrollToBottom`](#should-scroll-to-bottom)).
- Continuous scrolling down as new messages arrive ([`shouldAutoScroll`](#should-auto-scroll)).
- An "Auto scroll" button appears when scrolled up, allowing users to jump back to the latest messages ([`autoScroll`](#auto-scroll)).
- A loading indicator displays while the assistant is processing ([`status`](#status)).
- Submitted messages are scrolled to the top of the viewport and the height of the last user message is dynamically adjusted.
::

### Messages

Use the `messages` prop to display a list of chat messages.

### Status

prettier: true

  - status
props:
  status: 'submitted'
  messages:

      parts:
        - type: 'text'
          text: 'Hello, how are you?'

::

::note
Here's the detail of the different statuses from the AI SDK v5 Chat class:

- `submitted`: The message has been sent to the API and we're awaiting the start of the response stream.
- `streaming`: The response is actively streaming in from the API, receiving chunks of data.
- `ready`: The full response has been received and processed; a new user message can be submitted.
- `error`: An error occurred during the API request, preventing successful completion.
::

### User

Use the `user` prop to change the [ChatMessage](/docs/components/chat-message) props for `user` messages. Defaults to:

- `side: 'right'`{lang="ts-type"}
- `variant: 'soft'`{lang="ts-type"}

Humidity levels are moderate at around 65%, and wind speeds are light at 8 km/h from the southeast. Air quality is good with an index of 42. The UV index is high at 7, so it's recommended to wear sunscreen if you're planning to spend time outdoors.

### Should Auto Scroll

Use the `should-auto-scroll` prop to enable/disable continuous auto scroll while messages are streaming. Defaults to `false`.

```vue
<template>
  <UChatMessages :messages="messages" should-auto-scroll />
</template>
```

### Should Scroll To Bottom

Use the `should-scroll-to-bottom` prop to enable/disable bottom auto scroll when the component is mounted. Defaults to `true`.

```vue
<template>
  <UChatMessages :messages="messages" :should-scroll-to-bottom="false" />
</template>
```

## Examples

::note{to="https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/getting-started/nuxt" target="_blank"}
These chat components are designed to be used with the **AI SDK v5** from **Vercel AI SDK**.
::

::callout{icon="i-simple-icons-github" to="https://github.com/nuxt-ui-templates/chat" target="_blank"}
Check out the source code of our **AI Chat template** on GitHub for a real-life example.
::

### Within a page

Use the ChatMessages component with the `Chat` class from AI SDK v5 to display a list of chat messages within a page.

Pass the `messages` prop alongside the `status` prop that will be used for the auto scroll and the indicator display.

```vue [pages/\[id\\].vue] {2-5,8,12-16,20}
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Chat } from '@ai-sdk/vue'
import { getTextFromMessage } from '@nuxt/ui/utils/ai'

const input = ref('')

const chat = new Chat({
  onError(error) {
    console.error('Chat error:', error)
  }
})

const handleSubmit = (e: Event) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  chat.sendMessage({ text: input.value })
  input.value = ''
}
</script>

<template>
  <UDashboardPanel>
    <template #body>
      <UContainer>
        <UChatMessages :messages="chat.messages" :status="chat.status">
          <template #content="{ message }">
            <MDC :value="getTextFromMessage(message)" :cache-key="message.id" unwrap="p" />
          </template>
        </UChatMessages>
      </UContainer>
    </template>

    <template #footer>
      <UContainer>
        <UChatPrompt v-model="input" :error="chat.error" @submit="handleSubmit">
          <UChatPromptSubmit :status="chat.status" @stop="chat.stop" @reload="chat.regenerate" />
        </UChatPrompt>
      </UContainer>
    </template>
  </UDashboardPanel>
</template>
```

::note
In this example, we use the `MDC` component from [`@nuxtjs/mdc`](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/mdc) to render the content of the message. The `getTextFromMessage` utility extracts the text content from the AI SDK V5 message parts. As Nuxt UI provides pre-styled prose components, your content will be automatically styled.
::

### With indicator slot

You can customize the loading indicator that appears when the status is `submitted`.

## API

### Props

:component-props

### Slots

:component-slots

::tip
You can use all the slots of the [`ChatMessage`](/docs/components/chat-message#slots) component inside ChatMessages, they are automatically forwarded allowing you to customize individual messages when using the `messages` prop.

```vue{3-5}
<script setup lang="ts">
import { getTextFromMessage } from '@nuxt/ui/utils/ai'
</script>

<template>
  <UChatMessages :messages="messages" :status="status">
    <template #content="{ message }">
      <MDC :value="getTextFromMessage(message)" :cache-key="message.id" unwrap="p" />
    </template>
  </UChatMessages>
</template>
```
