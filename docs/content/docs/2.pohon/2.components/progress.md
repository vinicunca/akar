## Usage

Use the `v-model` directive to control the value of the Progress.

::docs-pohon-preview
---
external:
  - modelValue
props:
  modelValue: 50
---
::

### Max

Use the `max` prop to set the maximum value of the Progress.

::docs-pohon-preview
---
external:
  - modelValue
props:
  modelValue: 3
  max: 4
---
::

Use the `max` prop with an array of strings to display the active step under the bar, the maximum value of the Progress is the length of the array.

  - modelValue

  modelValue: 3
  max:
    - 'Waiting...'
    - 'Cloning...'

Use the `status` prop to display the current Progress value above the bar.

external:
  - modelValue
props:

### Indeterminate

When no `v-model` is set or the value is `null`, the Progress becomes _indeterminate_. The progress bar is animated as a `carousel`, but you can change it using the [`animation`](#animation) prop.

  animation: swing

### Orientation

Use the `orientation` prop to change the orientation of the Progress. Defaults to `horizontal`.
