## Usage

### Changing `as` value

If you want to change the default element or component being render, you can set the default `as` when defining the props.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import type { APrimitiveProps } from 'akar';
import { APrimitive } from 'akar';

const props = withDefaults(defineProps<APrimitiveProps>(), {
  as: 'span'
});
</script>

<template>
  <!-- Now this element will be rendered as `span` by default -->
  <APrimitive v-bind="props">
    ...
  </APrimitive>
</template>
```

### Render `asChild`

Change the default rendered element for the one passed as a child, merging their props and behavior.<br><br>Read our [Composition](/docs/akar/guides/composition) guide for more details.
