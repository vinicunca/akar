# Slot

::note
The different between this component from [Vue native slot](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/slots.html) is how it handles the `attributes` assigned to it.
::

Native slot treat any binded value as [Scoped Slots](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/slots.html#scoped-slots), where the values will be exposed to the parent template and be consumed.

But Akar's slot behave differently, it would merge all the assigned attributes onto it's immediate child.

## Example

Say we want to assign an `id` attribute to whatever component/element that was rendered, but Native slot will convert it into a scoped slot, and you will need to assign that id manually.

```vue
<!-- Native Slot -->
<!-- comp.vue -->
<template>
  <slot id="akar-01">
    ...
  </slot>
</template>

<!-- parent template -->
<template>
  <Comp v-slot="slotProps">
    <button :id="slotProps.id">...<button>
  <Comp>
<template>
```

This would be troublesome if you want to ensure some attributes are being passed onto certain element, maybe for accessibility reason.

Alternatively, If you use `Slot` from Akar, the attributes assigned to the Slot component will be inherited by the immediate child element, but you will no longer have access to the `Scoped Slot`,

```vue
<!-- Akar Slot -->
<script setup lang="ts">
import { APrimitiveSlot } from 'akar';
</script>

<!-- comp.vue -->
<template>
  <APrimitiveSlot id="akar-01">
    ...
  </APrimitiveSlot>
</template>

<!-- parent template -->
<template>
  <Comp>
    <!-- id will be inherited -->
    <button>...<button>
  <Comp>
<template>
```
