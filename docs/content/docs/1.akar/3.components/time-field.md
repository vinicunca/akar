## Preface

The component depends on the [@internationalized/date](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/internationalized/date/index.html) package, which solves a lot of the problems that come with working with dates and times in JavaScript.

We highly recommend reading through the documentation for the package to get a solid feel for how it works, and you'll need to install it in your project to use the date-related components.

## Installation

Install the date package.

::code-group{sync="pm"}

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @internationalized/date
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @internationalized/date
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @internationalized/date
```
::

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```vue
<script setup>
import {
  ATimeFieldInput,
  ATimeFieldRoot,
} from 'akar';
</script>

<template>
  <ATimeFieldRoot>
    <ATimeFieldInput />
  </ATimeFieldRoot>
</template>
```
