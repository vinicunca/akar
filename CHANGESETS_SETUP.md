# Changesets Setup Complete! ✅

## What's Been Set Up

### 1. **Changesets Configuration** (`.changeset/config.json`)
- Configured for monorepo with public access
- Set to ignore `docs` package
- Base branch: `main`

### 2. **GitHub Actions Workflows**

#### **`.github/workflows/release-changeset.yaml`** (NEW)
- Runs on push to `main`
- Automatically creates "Version Packages" PR when changesets are detected
- Publishes changed packages to npm when Version PR is merged
- Creates GitHub releases with proper tags (e.g., `akar@1.11.1`, `pohon-ui@1.0.1`)

#### **`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`** (NEW)
- Runs on PRs and main branch
- Builds all packages
- Runs tests
- Warns if changesets are missing on PRs with package changes

### 3. **Package.json Updates**

#### Root `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "changeset": "changeset",
    "version": "changeset version",
    "release": "pnpm build && changeset publish"
  }
}
```

#### All packages now have:
```json
{
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### ✅ No More Manual Git Tags
- Changesets handles everything automatically
- Tags are created per package (e.g., `akar@1.11.1`, `pohon-ui@1.0.1`)

### ✅ Independent Package Versioning
- Each package can have its own version
- Only changed packages are published
- No need to bump all packages together

### ✅ Automatic Changelog Generation
- Each changeset becomes a CHANGELOG entry
- Clear history of what changed in each version

### ✅ Safe Release Process
- Version PR for review before publishing
- See exactly what will be published
- Easy to catch mistakes before they go live

## 🚀 How to Use (Quick Start)

### For Developers:

1. **Make your changes** in any package
2. **Add a changeset**:
   ```bash
   pnpm changeset
   ```
3. **Commit everything** including the changeset file
4. **Create a PR** and merge when approved

### For Maintainers:

1. **Merge PRs** with changesets to `main`
2. **Review the "Version Packages" PR** that's automatically created
3. **Merge the Version PR** when ready to release
4. **Packages are published automatically** 🎉

## 📦 What Happens on Release

```
Merge Version PR
    ↓
GitHub Actions Runs
    ↓
Builds: akar, plugins, pohon-ui
    ↓
Publishes only changed packages to npm
    ↓
Creates GitHub releases:
  - akar@1.11.1 (if changed)
  - pohon-ui@1.0.1 (if changed)
  - plugins@1.11.1 (if changed)
```

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Test the setup**:
   ```bash
   # Make a small change to test
   cd packages/core
   # Edit a file
   pnpm changeset
   # Select akar, choose patch
   git add .
   git commit -m "test: changesets setup"
   git push
   ```

2. **Remove old release workflow** (optional):
   - `.github/workflows/release.yaml` - This is the old tag-based workflow
   - You can keep it as backup or remove it

3. **Update documentation**:
   - Add link to `CHANGESETS_GUIDE.md` in README
   - Inform team about new workflow

## 📚 Documentation

- See `CHANGESETS_GUIDE.md` for detailed usage guide
- [Changesets Documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

## 🔐 Required GitHub Secrets

Ensure these are configured in your repository settings:

- ✅ `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Auto-provided by GitHub
- ✅ `VINICUNCA_NPM_TOKEN` - Your npm publish token (already set)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Git tags are still created** - but automatically by the workflow per package
2. **Old `bumpp` script** - You don't need this anymore, can remove it
3. **`pub:release` script** - Not needed anymore, changesets handles publishing
4. **PRs to main** - Always include changesets for package changes
